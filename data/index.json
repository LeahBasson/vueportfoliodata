       "I'm excited to invite you to explore and get to know a bit more about me. I'm Leah Basson, a 20-year-old from the southern suburbs, with a passion for design and web development. Inspired by my love for technology and Marvel movies, particularly Iron Man, I believe in the limitless possibilities of technology. I am goal oriented, sometimes I lose track of time because I'm so invested in my tasks and projects. I am an organized person so I like making to do lists. I'm not afraid to ask questions and I work well in a team."
